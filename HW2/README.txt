Build and Run Instructions:

First, if not already done, you must build SFML from source using CMAKE, as automated with the provided sfml-install script in piazza
    this is in order to be able to use dymanic libraries
To ensure compatability with SFML3.0.0, make sure your library path is specified in the makefile in SFML flags for dynamic linking

next, in the directory with main.cpp run the command
    make run
then execute the executable produced, it is probably ./steering or whatever the LLM chose to call it.

Press 1, 2, 3, and 4 on your keyboard to view the different demonstrations respective to each part.
